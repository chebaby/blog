Through out this serie, i will take you in a tour, where i intent to show you how i build a showroom gallery for artisana products.

First of all lets take a look to what we gon to be builing.

This is a small project, it's quite simple actualy, it has the following 5 pages:

Home page
Category page
Product page
About page
Contact page

It seems to me like the most important pages (developement-wise) are category and product page, so i will be focusing about those in the comming blog posts.

In the next post, we will be talking about database modeling.
