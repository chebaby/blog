Throughout this series, I will take you in a tour to show you how to build an online showroom gallery for artisanal products. I call it "showroom". Original, isn't it?

First lets take a look to what we gon to be building throughout this whole series.

[image - catgories] [image - product details]

This is relatively a small project, it's quite simple actualy, it has the following 5 pages:

* Home page
* Category page
* Product page
* About page
* Contact page

It seems to me like the most important pages (development-wise) are category page and product details page. So, I will be focusing on those in the coming blog posts.

### Prerequisites

As a heads up, I assume that you have some basic understanding about web development as well as Laravel. And that you've at least build a composer-powered application previously, especially with Laravel. Therefore, I will not cover the basics.  
You might want to visit [Laravel Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x) if there is a need to catch up.

In the next post, we will be talking about database modeling.
