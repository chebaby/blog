I'm NOUR-EDDINE ECH-CHEBABY and I'm Backend Developer.

I started my career as Frontend developer, mainly JavaScript. I joined [Grafimage](https://www.grafimage.com){:target="_blank"} 4 years ago, since then, I'm working as Senior Backend Developer with PHP as a language of choice.

During my professional journey as web developer, I worked on variety of exciting [projects](https://echebaby.com/#portfolio).
